# hand_gesture_recognition
3A OSY Project : Deep Learning and Computer Vision

The aim of the project is to automatically detect hand gesture by training a neural network on preprocessed images. 
The notebook contains all usefull fonctions to preprocess images, define and train neural networks and compute scores.
The report explains, in French, the complete process and the choice of the methods used.
